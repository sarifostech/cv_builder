# Memory - 2026-02-23

## Current Milestone
Sprint 1 development complete; entering validation phase

## Completed Items
- Backend API (Express + Prisma): auth, CV CRUD, autosave
- Frontend (Next.js): pages for login, signup, dashboard, builder shell; template picker; auth context; API client
- Git push to GitHub (sarifostech/cv_builder)
- Notion project hub and board populated; duplicate pages cleaned
- All Sprint 0 and Sprint 1 code committed

## Decisions Made
- Minimal lightweight scaffolding to avoid agent timeouts
- Direct file creation instead of subagents for code generation
- Notion as source of truth for docs and tasks
- Git integration established with SSH/HTTPS token

## Risks
- Backend/frontend not yet smoke-tested; could have integration issues (CORS, auth flow, API contract mismatches)
- Database schema: need to run prisma migrate and generate
- Environment config: .env files need actual DB_URL
- Frontend: AuthContext initialization logic may have bugs (double useState set)
- PDF export not started (Sprint 3)
- Dual-mode preview placeholder only

## Next Actions
- Spawn tester to validate current Sprint 1 implementation (auth + builder shell) and produce test report
- Based on tester findings, fix blockers and retest
- Then proceed to Sprint 2 (section editing, dual-mode preview)
- Continue sprints until MVP feature-complete

## Notes
User MK requested review/test before continuing. Tester will produce `docs/test_reports/YYYY-MM-DD-sprint1-validation.md` with findings and pass/fail per AC.
