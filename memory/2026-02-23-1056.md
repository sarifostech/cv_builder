assistant: I’ll add the agents to the allowlist and register them so they appear in the GUI and can be orchestrated. First, let me check the current OpenClaw configuration to see where agents are defined.
assistant: I’ll update the OpenClaw configuration to add your team agents to the allowlist and register their definitions so they appear in the GUI and can be orchestrated.
assistant: Good, allowlist updated. Now let me add the agent definitions to the config so they’re properly registered and visible in the GUI. I’ll add entries with their prompts and defaults.
assistant: Perfect. I’ve registered the agents in the config and added their prompts. Now restart the gateway so the GUI picks up the new agents:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

After that, open the Agents window (or refresh it) – you should see all your team members: Orchestrator, Business Analyst, Product Owner, Project Manager, Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, Senior Dev, System Admin, and Tester. Once they appear, we can start the first app development cycle. Let me know when it’s done!

[Mon 2026-02-23 10:28 UTC] I had to remove the changes to the openclaw.json because of this error Invalid config: - agents: Unrecognized keys: "allowlist", "entries"
assistant: My apologies—the config structure I used isn’t correct for this version of OpenClaw. I’ll look up the proper way to define custom agents in the docs and adjust. One moment.
assistant: We need to define these as full agents under `agents.list` (each with its own workspace) and then allow the main agent to spawn them via `subagents.allowAgents`. I’ll adjust the config accordingly and create the necessary workspace folders with AGENTS.md for each. First, let me restore a clean agents section and add the list properly.
assistant: I'll now create the agent workspaces and AGENTS.md files, then update the config to register these agents and allow main to spawn them. This will make them appear in the GUI and be usable.
assistant: Now I’ll update the OpenClaw config to register these agents and allow the main agent to spawn them.
assistant: All set. I’ve added the agents to the config with their workspaces and allowed main to spawn them. Restart the gateway so the Agents window updates:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

After it’s back, refresh the Agents GUI—your team should appear. Then we can start the first app by telling me what you want to build. Ready when you are!

[Mon 2026-02-23 10:43 UTC] Hello
assistant: Hello! We’ve set up your agent team and restarted the gateway. There’s an auth issue: the main agent is missing an Anthropic API key. We can either configure that or stick with the GPT-5 Nano model we’ve been using. What would you like to do?
