Search for active instagram companies in Mozambique that don’t have a website. Build a list of those companies and try to get their contacts. Create a csv file with all output. Search till we have at least 20

Are you there?
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]I’m here. I’ve been trying to pull Instagram profile info through the sandboxed tools, but I’m running into two blockers: our browser automation can’t start (gateway issue) and the web search proxy won’t let me query Instagram pages directly—most profile viewers now throw CAPTCHAs or 403s from this environment. Without a working browser session or an API that can return profile data, I can’t reliably collect 20 Mozambican Instagram businesses (and confirm they lack websites or gather contacts) right now.

If you can supply a list of candidate Instagram handles (or run the browsing yourself and share the raw info), I can absolutely clean it up, verify who lacks sites, and build the CSV. Otherwise we may need to wait until the OpenClaw browser/gateway is online again or until we have an alternate data source. Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

What should I call you?
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]I haven’t picked a name yet—want to give me one? Otherwise I’ll just stick with “your assistant” for now.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "16",
  "sender_id": "8457347078",
  "sender": "8457347078"
}
```

I want you to pick one
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Alright, I’ll go with **Nico**. Works for you?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "18",
  "sender_id": "8457347078",
  "sender": "8457347078"
}
```

Why Nico?
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Short, easy to say in any language, feels grounded but still flexible—like I can pop into anything from spreadsheets to strategy without sounding like a corporate bot. And I just like how it sounds.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "20",
  "sender_id": "8457347078",

}
```

Ok. Nico it is

What is the system usage?

Current context footprint: ~33k tokens of the 400k limit (about 8%), cache hit rate 99% with 98k tokens cached. Runtime is direct, reasoning trace disabled, no elevation. Queue is idle.

}
```

How about at the OS level?
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]We’re running Ubuntu with kernel 6.14.0-37-generic on host vps-a3006ca7 (64-bit). Hardware-wise you’ve got 4 vCPUs, 7.6 GiB RAM (about 1 GiB in use, 3.5 GiB free, 3.4 GiB in cache), and no swap configured.
